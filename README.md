## Objective - Workshop in 1 sentence

**Get the current deal for a French Michelin starred restaurants.**

## How to do that?

By creating a link between [restaurant.michelin.fr](https://restaurant.michelin.fr/), [lafourchette.com](https://www.lafourchette.com) and the end-user.

I used a Mlab MongoDB database to store my data.
